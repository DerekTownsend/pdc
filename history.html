                <p class="case">Pilgrim Development Corp. is a 501c-3 founded by New Mount Pilgrim MBC. PDC was created to oversee the building of affordable housing in the neighborhood. We were able to accomplish these through the construction of 10 beautiful houses,
                    which have provided stability and wealth for our neighbors. This taste of development left us hungry for more.
                    
                    <br>Before we tell you more of our story, we want you to hear what other people are saying about West Garfield Park. Google it. Seriously, we will wait. 
                <img src="images/placeholder.png" height="150px" align="right"></img>
                What did you see? Probably news reports on crime, poverty statistics, advertisements for community service organizations etc. What most of this boils down to is that West Garfield Park is deemed poor, dangerous, and unworthy of investment.
                
                <img src="images/placeholder.png" height="150px" align="left"></img>
                This wasn't always the case. 50 years ago West Garfield Park was a middle-class neighborhood. The transformation that occurred is a tale of corrupt housing and insurance discrimination, riots, white flight, and neglect. History has not
                    been kind to our home. 
                <img src="images/placeholder.png" height="150px" align="right"></img>
                The present is also a challenge. In 2014 we had the highest murder rate and the lowest life expectancy of any neighborhood in Chicago. 47% of us live at or below the poverty line. What the history and the statistics leave out is that there
                    are people who live here who are ready to write a different story about our neighborhood.
                <img src="images/placeholder.png" height="150px" align="left"></img>
                In looking out on our neighborhood we realized that we were in a unique position to bring positive change. As the non-profit arm of a church that has been in the area for 60 years we have deep connections with the community and its leaders.
                    We have also been blessed with a variety of friends and partners throughout the city over the years. We decided to bring these people and resources together and together we have created a vision of development for our neighborhood.
                    To see this vision please look at our project pages. We are confident that you will want to be a part of this new story we are telling. </p>
